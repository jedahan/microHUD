microHUD

  * Removes the build number from the game GUI
  * Removes the health and armor bars from the marine HUD

microHUD is a collection of mods that help minimize the hud in a modular way. Each mod is as small as possible, favoring commenting out or modifying the least number of lines of lua code over changing game assets.
